# Kafka Configuration
kafka:
  broker: "localhost:9092"
  group_id: "kafka-mqtt-bridge"
  
  # SASL Authentication (required for Azure Event Hubs)
  # Azure Event Hubs uses SASL PLAIN authentication with the connection string
  # sasl:
  #   enabled: true
  #   mechanism: "PLAIN"  # Supported: PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-512
  #   # For Azure Event Hubs, use "$ConnectionString" as username
  #   username: "$ConnectionString"
  #   # For Azure Event Hubs, use the full connection string as password
  #   # Format: Endpoint=sb://<namespace>.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=<keyname>;SharedAccessKey=<key>
  #   password: "your-connection-string-here"
  
  # TLS Configuration (required for Azure Event Hubs)
  # Azure Event Hubs requires TLS for all connections
  # tls:
  #   enabled: true
  #   # When ca_file is not specified, system CA certificates are used (recommended for most cases)
  #   # ca_file: "/path/to/ca.crt"  # Optional: Path to custom CA certificate
  #   # cert_file: "/path/to/client.crt"  # Optional: For mutual TLS
  #   # key_file: "/path/to/client.key"   # Optional: For mutual TLS
  #   insecure_skip_verify: false
  
  # Avro Serialization/Deserialization Configuration
  # When enabled, Kafka messages will be serialized/deserialized using Avro format
  # with Confluent Schema Registry integration
  # avro:
  #   enabled: true
  #   # URL of the Confluent Schema Registry
  #   schema_registry_url: "http://localhost:8081"
  #   # Optional: Authentication credentials for Schema Registry
  #   # schema_registry_username: "username"
  #   # schema_registry_password: "password"
  #   # Subject name strategy: "topic" (default), "record", or "topic_record"
  #   # - topic: Uses <topic>-value and <topic>-key as subject names
  #   # - record: Uses <record-name>-value and <record-name>-key
  #   # - topic_record: Uses <topic>-<record-name>-value and <topic>-<record-name>-key

# MQTT Configuration
mqtt:

  username: ""
  password: ""
  client_id: "kafka-mqtt-bridge"
  
  # QoS level for MQTT operations (0, 1, or 2). Default: 1
  # QoS 0: At most once - Fire and forget, no acknowledgment
  # QoS 1: At least once - Message is delivered at least once (may be duplicated)
  # QoS 2: Exactly once - Message is delivered exactly once (highest overhead)
  # For MQTT→Kafka bridging, messages are acknowledged (Ack) only after 
  # successful delivery to Kafka, ensuring reliable message transfer.
  qos: 1
  
  # CleanSession flag. Default: false when QoS > 0, true otherwise
  # When false, the broker stores subscriptions and queued messages for the client
  # This is important for QoS > 0 to ensure message delivery after reconnection
  # clean_session: false
  
  # TLS Configuration for secure MQTT connections
  # tls:
  #   enabled: true
  #   # When ca_file is not specified, system CA certificates are used (recommended for most cases)
  #   # ca_file: "/path/to/ca.crt"  # Optional: Path to custom CA certificate

  #   # Path to client private key file (optional, for mutual TLS authentication)
  #   key_file: "/path/to/client.key"

# Bridge Configuration
